## Overview

Cookconnect provides APIs and tooling for managing foodservice workflows, user roles, and sensitive data. Security is a first-class concern: the system is built with modern secure coding practices and is subject to ongoing security reviews.

---

## Security Architecture

- **Authentication:** Supports OAuth2 and JWT-based authentication. All endpoints require authentication.
- **Authorization:** Fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at the API level.
- **Data Encryption:** All data in transit is encrypted with TLS 1.2+; sensitive data at rest is encrypted using AES-256.
- **Secret Management:** Environment secrets are never committed to source and should be managed via a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other common web vulnerabilities.
- **Logging:** Security-relevant events are logged and auditable. Sensitive data is always masked in logs.
- **Dependencies:** All dependencies are monitored for vulnerabilities using tools like Dependabot or Snyk.

## Key Features

- Secure RESTful APIs for user and workflow management
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Audit logging for critical actions
- Configurable RBAC for users and service accounts
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.x / Python >= 3.10 (adapt to your stack)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Access to a supported RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- [Recommended] A secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GurkhaShieldForce/Cookconnect.git
    cd Cookconnect
    ```

2. Configure secrets and environment variables (never commit secrets to source):
    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.
    - Integrate with your organization's secrets manager if possible.

3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install    # Or: pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run database migrations:
    ```sh
    npm run migrate   # Or: python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Start the application:
    ```sh
    npm start         # Or: python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Configuration

- All configuration is handled via environment variables.
- Sensitive keys and tokens **must** be injected at runtime and never stored in source control.
- Review `config/` or equivalent directory for security-related tunables.

---

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secure_Coding_Cheat_Sheet.html).
- Write unit and integration tests for all new features; prioritize security boundary testing.
- Code reviews must include a security checklist.
- Use static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, Bandit, SonarQube).

---

## Security Best Practices

- Never log secrets, passwords, or sensitive personal data.
- Rotate credentials and keys regularly.
- Keep all dependencies up-to-date.
- Monitor and address security advisories promptly.
- Use signed commits and enable branch protection rules.
- Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity.
